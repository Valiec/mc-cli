# mc-cli
CLI minecraft server console

Uses the https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server Docker image for running servers.

## Installing

1. Install dependencies (for now, just Docker, Bash, and the GNU coreutils if you don't have them).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. `cd` into the repo directory and run install.sh to install the tool. It defaults to installing to `/usr/local/bin`, specify a path as an argument if you want to install somewhere else.

## Documentation

Pending, for now use `mccli help`.
